# Introduction

This is the source code for my new and improved [personal website](https://www.andrewvoneshen.com).

If you have any issues or comments, please send me a note, or raise an issue here.

## Coming Soon

Here's a preview of what I have planned next for this site:

### Projects API
 - Projects API on AWS
 - Refactored Projects page - dynamic contents, and more projects!
 - Better state, using Redux
 - Dynamic Project List

## Acknowledgements

I heavily relied on create-react-app, and community examples, particularly the following:

 - [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/)
 - [Product Compare React](https://github.com/Rhymond/product-compare-react)

The blue theme is inspired by a certain football team from West London ü¶Å
