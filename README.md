# Introduction

This is the source code for my new and improved personal website.

## To Do

 - Homepage Images
 - Redesigned AboutMe & CSS
 - Refactored Projects page - dynamic contents, and more projects!
 - Better state, using Redux
 - Projects API on AWS
 - Dynamic Project List
 - Readme Writeup

## Acknowledgements

I heavily relied on create-react-app, and community examples, particularly the following:

 - [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/)
 - [Product Compare React](https://github.com/Rhymond/product-compare-react)

The blue theme is inspired by a certain football team from West London ü¶Å
