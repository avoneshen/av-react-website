# Introduction

This is the source code for my new and improved [personal website](https://www.andrewvoneshen.com).

If you have any issues or comments, please send me a note, or raise an issue here.

## Coming Soon

Here's a preview of what I have planned next for this site:

### Projects API
 - [] Better state, using Redux
 - [] Projects API on AWS
 - [] Image Hosting for API
 - [] Refactored Projects page - dynamic contents, and more projects!
 - [] Dynamic Project List
 - [] Properly guard HTML to use dangerouslyParseInnerHTML
 - [] remove orphans

## In Flight

Managing State

 - []
 - []
 - [] Finish the redux jobs
 - [] True Favicon
 - [] Push new Site to github
 - [] Design Image / Product service back-end
 - [] Off-site image CDN
 - [] True API

### Redux

 To Do: Untangle the knot I've written into the projects reducer. It currently returns projects: { projects: [] } - it ought to just be the root array not the second object wrapper.

 Part of that is the handling of the API call the other part is the initial loads.

 - [] clean comments
 - [] COMMIT
 - [] Deploy to test
 - [] Test Projects, Cards, X-Browsers Compat, Responsive App func

## Acknowledgements

I heavily relied on create-react-app, and community examples, particularly the following:

 - [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/)
 - [Product Compare React](https://github.com/Rhymond/product-compare-react)

The blue theme is inspired by a certain football team from West London ü¶Å
