## Acknowledgements

I heavily relied on create-react-app, and community examples, particularly the following:

 - [Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com/)
 - [Product Compare React](https://github.com/Rhymond/product-compare-react)

The blue theme is inspired by a certain football team from West London ü¶Å
